## Probability

Many of these solutions are based on the concept of Random or Monte-Carlo Simulations.  Essentially generate random simulations and discover the pattern that emerges:  i.e. negative expected value in Roulette or an optimal betting strategy for poker using expected value.

Random simulations also play a role in optimizing heuristics like greedy random start for the TSP.

Examples include:

* Poker Simulator
* Roulette Simulator

### Startup Game

This simulates thousands of runs of the startup game

`python probability/startup_game.py simulate_multiple`
